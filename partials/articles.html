                <p>Money doesn't actually exist. This statement might sound funny coming from the guy who is constantly urging CEOs to pay their employees more. Sure, money exists in that we can hold paper bills and silver coins in our hands, and watch the numbers on our bank statements rise and fall. But the value of money is essentially imaginary. Its only value exists in what we as a society assign to it. And, unfortunately, we tend to assign it way more than it's actually worth.</p>
                <p>Money is only valuable because it gives us access to things, like bread or shoes that we need or want, or to having new experiences or the ability to give back. If we had ready access to everything we could possibly need, we'd have no use for money. And yet the vast majority of us pursue money as its own reward, even after we have enough to obtain the goods and services we need. And, of course, the vast majority of the world's population doesn't earn enough money to meet their most basic needs.</p>   
                <p>We do ourselves a disservice by evaluating our lives through money and not a more complex target. We set ourselves up for a life in which we pursue something that, after a certain point, will not make our lives better and may, in some cases, even make it worse. For, as the Bible also tells us, "Money is the root of all kinds of evil," not because it is bad (it isn't), but because it distracts us from the things that really bring our life meaning. We need to challenge ourselves to value things like love, relationships, connection, justice, experience, charity, wisdom, and self-worth--things that are difficult to measure but that add real value to our lives. By doing so, we will edge out the primacy of money and direct our lives toward worthier pursuits, toward the things that actually exist.</p>

                <p>Engineers design plants using genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to improve taste, nutritional content, and resilience. However, people have concerns over their safety, and there is much debate about the pros and cons of using GMOs. Scientists create GMO foods by introducing genetic material, or DNA, from a different organism through genetic engineering. Most of the currently available GMO foods are plants, such as fruit and vegetables.</p> 
                <p>GMO foods are likely to become a crucial tool in feeding the world’s growing population, especially in areas with harsh climates. However, there have been concerns about possible risks. Manufacturers use genetic modification to give foods desirable traits. Potential advantages of GMO crops include: increased attractiveness to consumers; enhanced flavor; longer shelf life and therefore less waste; greater resistance to viruses and other diseases, which could lead to less waste and increased food security; increased nutritional value, as in golden rice, which can boost the health of people with limited access to food; ability to thrive in a harsh climate, such as drought or heat and ability to grow in salty soil.</p>
                <p>Genetically engineering foods is a relatively new practice, which means the long-term effects on safety are not yet clear. Many concerns about the disadvantages relate to human health. Scientists have not yet shown that GMO foods are harmful to health, but research is ongoing.</p>

                <p>Humans have been able to use AI with technologies such as brain-computer interfaces, nanobots, and virtual assistants for decades. It’s now possible to connect our brains with a super intelligent AI and make ourselves a million times more intelligent. This AI can guide us throughout everyday life and help us instantly make optimal decisions regardless of the situation. All we have to do is give it our primary life objectives and the objectives we would like to achieve for each type of scenario and it does the rest.</p> 
                <p>With this technology, we can view practically any situation as an advanced math problem that we can easily solve. We can see 50 or more steps ahead before taking any action. We can multiply our returns in stock and crypto markets by orders of magnitude. We can predict seemingly unpredictable scenarios hours or days before they occur and we always know the best things to say for every situation. For example, using this technology, a politician could persuade non-enhanced people to do almost anything using only a few sentences.</p>
                <p>In 2100, humans are able to connect to a global network where the thoughts of billions of people are made available. There are many names for this concept including the hive mind, the global mind, and the brainternet. Anytime, we want, we can connect to a global network where we can access the thoughts of millions or even billions of people at a time. This concept can help large groups of people achieve time-sensitive objectives with unparalleled unison and cooperation. Companies, non-profits, and political organizations are exploring the use of this concept to facilitate more organized work. It’s even possible to access the memories and emotions of other people in the cloud to experience them anytime you want.</p>
